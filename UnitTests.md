# Unit tests

- The user should receive points based on their roll
- The game should keep running no matter what until either 0 health is reached, or the user chooses to exit the game with '-1' when in the main menu
- No infinite loops
- <Adding more + additional unit tests for each issue>

### **Issue:** Edits to rolling
- When the user chooses option 1 to roll, the program should add both the roll + bonus points from buffs to the users points total
