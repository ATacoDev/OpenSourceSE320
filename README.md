# CLI Dice Roller Game
- This is going to be a simple dice roller game played in the users terminal, in which the user is able to roll dice, earn points, and then use those points to purchase upgrades go gain even more points! Throughout the dice rolling experience, there will be a possibility for events to occur that will either work against or for the user in their attempt to gain more points!
